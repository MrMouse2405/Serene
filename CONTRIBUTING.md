## Contributing Guide and Standards

If you are looking to resolve an existing issue, add a new feature, or add documentation, please begin by **creating an issue** for the changes you are hoping to make.
All proposed changes are expected to be submitted as pull requests and we ask that contributiors preferably reference their pull request in the issue they have created. We will review the pull request and will either respond with any concerns or comments we have with the request or merge it with ```Serene:main```.
