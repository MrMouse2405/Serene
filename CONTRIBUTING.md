Thank you for contributing to our open source project! We are always looking for improvments and new features to improve our project.

Here is a set of guidlines for anyone looking to conbtribute to Serene:

## Contributing Guide and Standards

If you are looking to resolve an existing issue, add a new feature, or add documentation, please begin by **creating an issue** for the changes you are hoping to make.

We request that all changes are made locally on forked versions of Serene so we can review changes before merging your suggestions.

All proposed changes are expected to be submitted as pull requests and we ask that contributiors preferably reference their pull request in the issue they have created. We will review the pull request and will either respond with any concerns or comments we have with the request or merge it with ```Serene:main```.

If you have any questions or concerns, check out our ```README.md``` file or join our (public discord server)[https://discord.gg/RJxeZCwNmf].
